# NutritionCoach BT 2023
## Context
Many robotic assistants on the market can interact via body cues (i.e., face/head/arms movements), sounds (i.e., synthetized voice), and graphical interfaces. On the other hand, Large Language Models (used for instance by ChatGPT) currently revolutionalize interactions with computers and generation of content. Our goal is to combine them with robots.
Such robots have proven to greatly aid research in studies, including healthcare. Aligned with a previous study conducted by the Applied Intelligent Agents Lab (AISLab) of the Informatics Institute of HES-SO Valais-Wallis, in the context of this bachelor project, a robot named Qutie (https://luxai.com/) is intended to embody a simple personalized nutrition-oriented robot-aided by a Large Language Model (LLM). The content produced by the LLM will have to be aligned with coherent facial expressions, voice tones, and gestures.
## Goal
The goal of this bachelor project is to develop a simple robotic nutritional coach employing LLM. It will be based on Linux NUC that exposes Robotic Operating System APIs. The QT robot can be programmed with several programming languages (including Python).

The QT nutritional coach may include the following elements partially supported by some off-the-shelves pre-trained LLM:
<table>
<li>Extending an existing user profiling module (vegetarian, etc.)</li>
<li>Proposing general information or training on nutrition</li>
<li>Proposing recommendations of dishes given specific requests</li>
<li>Explaining the propositions ot the users</li>
<li>Gathering feedbacks from the users</li>
